# JavaScript Calculator

A simple yet fully functional web-based calculator built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
This project focuses on core JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling without using any external libraries or frameworks.

# Project Overview

This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (×)

Division (÷)

Decimal calculations

Clear / reset functionality

The main goal of this project was to strengthen JavaScript fundamentals, especially:

Handling user input

Managing application state

Writing clean and readable logic

# Features

Dynamic number input handling

Operator-based calculations

Supports chained calculations (e.g. 5 + 5 * 2)

Decimal input validation

Clear/reset button

Real-time display update using DOM manipulation


# Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Styling & layout

JavaScript (ES6+) – Logic & functionality

No frameworks, no libraries — pure JavaScript.


# What I Learned

Through this project, I learned and practiced:

DOM selection using querySelector and querySelectorAll

Event handling with addEventListener

Managing calculator state using variables

Object-based function mapping for operators

Preventing invalid inputs (multiple decimals, operator misuse)

Writing modular and readable functions
